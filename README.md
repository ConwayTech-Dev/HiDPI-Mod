# HiDPI-Mod

This is a modified version of @xzhih's one-key-hidpi script. It adds an additional 3:2 HiDPI option. This version of the script is purely for my own purposes, and it may be useful when dealing with Surface Hackintoshes.

# Usage

Run the following command in Terminal:
```bash
-c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conwaytech-dev/HiDPI-Mod/master/hidpi.sh)"
```

# Misc

Full credit to the original one-key-hidpi, which you can find [here](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi).
